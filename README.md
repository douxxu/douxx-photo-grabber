Douxx | Pgrabber is a script that lets you retrieve 10 photos from the Windows "photos" application, and send them via a discord webhook.
This script is for educational purposes only, and I disclaim all responsibility for any problems related to data theft caused by this script.
Simply run the script to retrieve the photos.

To work properly, the script requires:
- a Windows device (I don't think this script works on other OS)
- python
- the windows "photo" application

i love u
